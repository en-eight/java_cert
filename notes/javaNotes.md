*Notes taken from the W3 Schools Java course.*

* In Java, every application begins with a **class name** and that class 
**must match the filename**.

* Every line of code that runs in Java must be inside of a class - in the
hello world program `helloWorld.java` included in this repo, the class is
`helloWorld`. 

* Much of the same rules in C/C++ apply to Java, such as:
    * putting strings in double quotation marks: `""`
    * Data types being relatively similar
    * Semicolons on the end of each line
    * Comments behave exactly the same

### `println` method

* The `println` method can print strings, numbers, operations
* This method prints on a new line with each call
    * If you do not want this behavior, use `print` instead


----

### Datatypes

* `String` - the only data type that starts with a capital letter; stores text
* `int` - stores whole numbers, positive or negative
* `float` - stores floating point numbers 
* `char` - stores single characters
* `boolean`- t/f
* `byte` - stores whole nubmers from -128 to 127 
*

### Keywords

* `final` - declares the value as immutable, read-only. Same as C++ `const`.
